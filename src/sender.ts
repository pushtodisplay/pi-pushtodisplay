/**
 * The one queue between an event and the board.
 *
 * A panel is a scrolling history, so entries are a trail: they must be sent in
 * the order they happened, and a result must never be buried behind a pile of
 * steps. Sends are also rate-limited — every call costs a message from the
 * monthly quota and Sandbox tiers cap around 1 msg/s.
 *
 * Those two concerns used to live in two classes (`Outbox` + `RateLimiter`)
 * that each owned a queue, a drain loop, a `pending` and a `flush()`, with the
 * outbox awaiting the limiter so that one queue was always length ≤ 1. This is
 * that pair collapsed into one loop:
 *
 *  - **Order is the information.** Nothing is ever reordered.
 *  - **Bounded backlog.** Past `maxPending`, the oldest non-urgent entry is
 *    dropped: a trail that lags minutes behind the agent is worse than a
 *    shorter one.
 *  - **Consecutive duplicates are suppressed** at enqueue time, so `A, B, A`
 *    still posts both `A`s.
 *  - **Spacing is measured from the end of the previous send**, which is the
 *    conservative reading of "1 msg/s" (a slow CLI cannot compress the gap).
